Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. 
you will need an additional storage location for the data AND YOU MUST  COPY DATA REGULARLY 

Home network
Storing your data locally means that you have total control of it.
---
Secondary location
You could copy all of your data to a network attached storage device (NAS), a simple external hard drive 
or maybe even back up important folders on thumb drives, CDs, DVDs or tapes.

The cloud
You could subscribe to a cloud storage service, like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
 The cost of this service will depend on the amount of storage space you need
One of the benefits of using a cloud storage service is that your data is safe in the event of a storage device failure 
or if you experience an extreme situation such as a fire or theft.
