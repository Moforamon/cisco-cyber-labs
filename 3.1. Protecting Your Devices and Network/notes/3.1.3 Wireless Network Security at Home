3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home

Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID)

wireless router can be configured so that it doesnâ€™t broadcast the SSID<this should not be considered adequate security for a wireless network

Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password

encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption ( wireless network can still be vulnerable.)

 security flaw in the WPA2 protocol in 2017:

This vulnerability can be exploited by key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) by intruders. In simple terms, attackers break the encryption between a wireless router and a wireless device, giving them access to network data. This flaw affects all modern, protected Wi-Fi networks.

To mitigate this situation, you should:

update all wireless capable devices such as routers, laptops and mobile devices, as soon as security updates become available
use a wired connection for any devices with a wired network interface card (NIC)
use a trusted virtual private network (VPN) service when accessing a wireless network.
