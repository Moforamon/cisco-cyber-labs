---
On starting at @Apollo, your network password was emailed to you in plain text and you were not prompted to change it
Emailing sensitive information such as passwords in plain text is extremely risky and is a weakness in security practice.
 This information should at the very least be encrypted.
---
Past employees still have access to @Apolloâ€™s customer database
Past employees should not have access to customer information when leaving a company.
This is a serious access control problem

---
New users can log into their @Apollo account, even if they have signed up with an incorrectly formatted email address

New users need to be validated before anything else can be done with their data. 
Using an incorrectly formatted email address to log on is a non-validated input error.
