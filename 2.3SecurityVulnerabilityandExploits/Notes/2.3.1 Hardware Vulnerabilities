2.3.1 Hardware Vulnerabilities

---

Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. 
example:  memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component which can hold an electrical charge)
discovered that, due to their close proximity,changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor capacitors

Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer was created
By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM.

Meltdown and Spectre:
two hardware vulnerabilities that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released since 1995 within desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, smart devices and cloud services.
