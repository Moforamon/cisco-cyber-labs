You’ve logged into your laptop but it contains some photos belonging to the previous user,}
who no longer works at @Apollo. Your line manager asks you to delete them. 
You drag the photos into the recycle bin, open the recycle bin, select them and click ‘Delete’ once again. 
That should do it!
Answer 
No, the photos are just inaccessible from the operating system

When you move a file to the recycle bin and delete it permanently, the file is only inaccessible from the operating system.
 Anyone with the right forensic tools could still recover the file due to a magnetic trace left on the hard drive.
