That’s interesting! You wonder what security system is being implemented at @Apollo.

You ask the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who explains that the following security appliances are in place.

You have a chance to earn some defender points, so choose your answers carefully


Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) 4000. These routers have many capabilities, including traffic filtering, the ability to run an intrusion prevention system (IPS), encryption and VPN capabilities for secure encrypted tunneling.

Cisco’s Firepower 4100 Series is a next generation firewall that has all the capabilities of an ISR router, as well as advanced network management and analytics. It can help you to see what’s happening on the network so that you can detect attacks earlier.

Cisco’s AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a VPN system that lets remote workers use a secure encrypted tunnel from their mobile computer to securely connect back to the organization’s network. All Cisco security appliances are equipped with a VPN server and client technology, designed for secure encrypted tunneling.

Cisco’s Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is installed in next generation Cisco routers, firewalls, IPS devices and web and email security appliances. It can also be installed as software in host computers.
