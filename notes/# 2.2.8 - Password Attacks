# 2.2.8 - Password Attacks

This section outlines common password-based attack strategies used to gain unauthorized access to systems. Understanding these methods is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and applying the right countermeasures.

---

## Password Spraying

A password spraying attack involves attempting a **single commonly used password** across **many different usernames**. This method avoids triggering account lockout mechanisms by rotating attempts across multiple accounts rather than repeatedly targeting one.

---

## Dictionary Attacks

A dictionary attack uses a predefined list of commonly used passwords—typically sourced from leaked password databases—to guess a user's credentials. This approach is faster than brute-force methods because it targets passwords that are statistically more likely to be used.

---

## Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks attempt every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. While effective in theory, these attacks are time-consuming and can often be detected or mitigated through rate-limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

---

## Rainbow Table Attacks

Rather than computing hashes on the fly like in brute-force attacks, a rainbow table attack uses a **precomputed list of password hashes** and compares them to the target hash.

If a match is found, the attacker can determine the original password without recalculating anything.

**Mitigation strategies include:**
- Adding a **salt** to each password before hashing, which makes rainbow tables ineffective.
- Using secure hashing algorithms such as **bcrypt** or **Argon2**.
- Enabling **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to reduce reliance on passwords alone.

---

## Traffic Interception

This occurs when passwords or sensitive data are transmitted in **plain text** over a network. Attackers monitoring the traffic can intercept and read this data with minimal effort.

**Common scenario:** A user logs into an account over an unsecured public Wi-Fi connection. If the site is not using HTTPS, the attacker can easily read the login credentials in transit.

**Defensive measures include:**
- Always using **encrypted communication protocols** like HTTPS, SSH, or TLS.
- Avoiding the storage or transmission of passwords in plain text.
- Using **VPNs** to encrypt all internet traffic on untrusted networks.
